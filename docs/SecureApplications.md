# Secure Applications

## Certificate / Signing
- Any non-certified application can run but cannot access any system resources.
- Certified applications can access system resources.
- Regularly audit certified applications to ensure they are not compromised. 

## Sandbox
- Run applications in a sandboxed environment, to prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
- Certain flags can be set to allow access to specific resources (e.g. network, filesystem, etc).

## Virtualization
- The sandboxed environment runs as a virtual environment, to prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
