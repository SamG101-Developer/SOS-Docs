# User Authentication

## Multi-Factor Authentication
- Support multiple factor authentication (password, security token, biometrics).

## Biometric Authentication
- Require biometric authentication for critical operations (e.g. financial transactions).
- Disable certain features of the OS, until biometric authentication is provided.

## Password Policies
- Enforce strong password policies: length, complexity, history, expiration.
- Enforce password policies for all user accounts, including service accounts.

## Secure password storage
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms to hash and store passwords (Argon2).
- Implement salting techniques to protect against rainbow table attacks.

## Account lockout and intrusion prevention
- Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Integrate intrusion prevention systems to identify and response to suspicious activity.

## Secure authentication protocols
- Seamless integration with secure authentication protocols (Kerberos, OAuth, etc).
