# Kernel


## Interrupt Handling
- Establish a mechanism to handle interrupts, for asynchronous events (IO requests, hardware errors).
- Set up interrupt service routines, prioritize interrupts, and manage multiple interrupt requests.

## System Calls
- Define a set of system calls that provide an interface for user-space applications to interact with the kernel.
- Comprehensive set of system calls for lowest-level operations (process/memory/device/file management, etc).


## Error Handling & Logging
- Implement a robust error handling mechanism to detect and respond to errors.
- Develop a logging system to record detailed information about errors, and facilitate troubleshooting.
- Use a hierarchical error handling model, to ensure errors are handled at the appropriate level.
