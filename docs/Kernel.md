# Kernel

## Code signing
- Code signing to verify integrity of kernel modules.

## Process Management
- Handle creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- Process creation & synchronization, context switching, and efficient scheduling.

## Memory Management
- Develop a memory management system to allocate and deallocate memory.
- Memory protection, virtual memory, memory mapping.
- Prevent unauthorized access to memory, and memory leaks.
- Use "Address Space Layout Randomization" & "Data Execution Prevention"

## Device Management
- Implement a device management system to facilitate communication with hardware devices.
- Develop device drivers, and provide a common interface for interacting with devices.

## Interrupt Handling
- Establish a mechanism to handle interrupts, for asynchronous events (IO requests, hardware errors).
- Set up interrupt service routines, prioritize interrupts, and manage multiple interrupt requests.

## Inter-Process Communication
- Implement a mechanism to facilitate communication & data-sharing between processes.
- Shared memory, message passing, synchronization primitives, etc.

## System Calls
- Define a set of system calls that provide an interface for user-space applications to interact with the kernel.
- Comprehensive set of system calls for lowest-level operations (process/memory/device/file management, etc).

## Scheduler
- Develop a scheduler to manage the execution of processes.
- Implement various scheduling algorithms (round-robin, priority-based, etc).

## Error Handling & Logging
- Implement a robust error handling mechanism to detect and respond to errors.
- Develop a logging system to record detailed information about errors, and facilitate troubleshooting.
- Use a hierarchical error handling model, to ensure errors are handled at the appropriate level.

## File System
- See [File System](FileSystem.md).
