# Secure Boot
- Cryptographically verify the integrity of the bootloader & kernel before executing them.
- Hardware-based secure boot mechanisms to prevent unauthorized code from running on a system during boot time.

## Secure Boot Firmware
- Use a secure boot firmware that supports cryptographic verification of the bootloader & kernel.
- Implement firmware-level protections against unauthorized access & modification to the firmware (Secure One Technology).

## Cryptographic Signatures
- Require all boot components (bootloaders, drivers, kernel) to be digitally signed with a cryptographic signature.
- Use strong algorithms for generating and verifying cryptographic signatures, to ensure authenticity & integrity of boot components.

## Trusted Boot Environment
- Establish a trusted boot environment that securely measures and verifies each component's integrity during the boot process.
- Use a trusted platform module (TPM) to securely store cryptographic keys & integrity measurements of the boot components.

## Chain of Trust
- Implement a chain of trust, that verifies the authenticity & integrity of each boot component before allowing the next stage of the process to execute.
- Enforce a hierarchical trust model, to ensure only authorized and trusted components are allowed to execute during the boot process.

## Recovery & Backup Mechanisms
- Design a security recovery mechanism that allows restoration of the system to a known good state, in the event of a security compromise or boot-time failure.
- Implement secure backup mechanisms, such as system restore points and secure system image backups to facilitate recovery of the system.

## Secure Boot Configuration
- Provide the ability to customize and configure the secure boot process, to adjust management of trusted keys, secure boot policies and secure boot behaviour.
- Implement a secure boot configuration management tools to prevent unauthorized changes to the secure boot configuration & policies.

## Integrity Measurement Architecture
- Implement an integrity measurement architecture that securely measures and verifies the integrity of the boot components, during the boot process.
- Use IMA to generate and enforce security measurements that validate the integrity of critical system files, and detect unauthorized modification.

## Secure Boot Logs
- Establish a secure logging mechanism that records detailed information about the secure boot process (verification results, measures components, deviations from boot sequence etc).
- Encrypt and protect the secure boot logs, to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the logs.

## Secure Boot Recovery Mode
- Implement a secure recovery mode that allows the system to be troubleshooted and recovered from a security compromise or boot-time failure.
- Integrate secure recovery tools and procedures, to allow for the diagnosis and recovery of the system, without compromising security.
