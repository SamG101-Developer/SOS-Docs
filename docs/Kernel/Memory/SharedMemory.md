## Overview
- Mechanism used for inter-process communication.

- It is used to share data between processes, and to communicate between processes.

## Security
- All communication through shared memory is encrypted.
- Shared memory is reclaimed when the process that created it terminates.
- Shared memory contains signed shared memory access lists, which are used to control access to the shared memory.
