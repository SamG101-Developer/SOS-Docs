# Device Drivers
## Universal Driver Framework (UDF)
### UDF Overview
- The Universal Driver Framework (UDF) is a framework for writing device drivers.
- It is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to write drivers for a wide range of devices.
- Forced a streamlined, secure and efficient way to write drivers. 

### UDF Architecture
#### Core Components
- Memory Management: Manages the memory used by the driver.
- Interrupt Handling: Manages the interrupts generated by the device.
- Communication Protocols: Manages the communication between the driver and the device.
- Error Handling: Manages the errors generated by the device.

#### Device Specific Components
- Built on-top of the core components.
- Need to implement a set of abstract methods.
- Another set of methods unique to the driver would also be added.

#### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Abstracts the hardware details from the driver.
- Provides an API for the driver to interact with the hardware.

#### Sandboxing
- As device drivers act like normal processes, they are sandboxed.
- This means their permissions are restricted to prevent them from accessing unauthorized resources.
- This is done to prevent the driver from causing harm to the system.
